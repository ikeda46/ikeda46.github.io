### Abstract:

Compton imaging is an emerging method to visualize X- and gamma-ray sources. Regardless of the expanding use of the Compton imaging, most conventional image reconstruction methods do not derive uncertainties that should be defined on each resulting image. We propose a new Compton imaging method, named Langevin Compton Imaging, that defines uncertainties of Compton images in a statistically well-founded manner. We quantitatively evaluate the statistical significance of image features, such as the presence of multiple source peaks. Moreover, our method enables us estimate the intensity ratio between source peaks.
