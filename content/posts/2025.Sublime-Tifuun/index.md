(SUBLIME-TIFUUN)

### Outline

Understanding the star-forming activity throughout the 13.8
billion-year history of the universe, along with the physical
processes that govern it, is crucial for unveiling the origins of
heavy elements and materials, which were formed within stars and
constitute the world and life. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
has now discovered galaxies in the early Universe, mere hundreds of
millions of years after the Big Bang, in the visible to mid-infrared
wavelengths. Sub/millimeter-wave observations are essential for
detecting star formation obscured by solid particles of heavy
elements, i.e., 'dust'.  There has been significant progress in
observing individually detectable bright galaxies using ALMA. However,
studying dust-enshrouded star formation in fainter, and thus more
numerous galaxies remains a formidable challenge, even with ALMA.

### Purpose

Obscured star-formation and heavy element productions via [CII] LIM We
propose to conduct the “line intensity mapping” (LIM) observations
targeting the ionized carbon emission [CII] 158$\mu$m line. LIM
measures the integral amount of energy emitted by the spectral lines
of galaxies averaged in the spatial and depth (redshift)
directions. Thus one can assess the contributions from faint and
numerous galaxies that are difficult to detect individually. We
develop the superconducting imaging spectrograph TIFUUN and
data-scientific methods to separate the atmospheric emission and
contaminating foreground lines. We will quantify the dust-obscured
star formation and clarify the formation and accumulation of heavy
elements in the first 2 billion years of the Universe by detecting the
[CII] LIM signals.
