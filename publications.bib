  abstract     = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a method to
                  reconstruct individual source signals from the
                  complex signal containing signals and noises from
                  various sources, based on the second or higher order
                  statistics of the complex signal, and has been found
                  to be useful for improvement of signal to noise
                  (S/N) ratio in electroencephalograms (EEGs) and
                  other electrophysiological recordings. We applied
                  ICA to magnetoencephalograms (MEGs) for separation
                  of MEG signals arising from different cortical areas
                  as well as for improvement of S/N ratio. MEG signals
                  recorded from 4 male subjects using a 129 channel
                  magnetometer focused to the left occipital cortex
                  during presentation of visual stimuli (stationary
                  sinusoidal grating and moving random dots) to the
                  right visual field. A demixing matrix was determined
                  so that 129 ICA components conveyed the minimum
                  cross-correlation (a range of time delay, 0--70
                  ms). Less than 10 of the entire components were
                  usually synchronized to the visual stimuli, and the
                  original MEGs were reconstructed by
                  inverse-transforming those components through the
                  inverse demixing matrix. There was a dramatic
                  improvement in the S/N ratio (10 times). In
                  addition, analysis by spatial filters transforming
                  MEGs into local currents in the brain (Toyama et
                  al., 1999) revealed that it was possible to identify
                  responses arising from different cortical areas
                  based on the temporal patterns of the ICA
                  components. Stationary sinusoidal grating produced a
                  single response localized in VI, while moving
                  random-dots produced multiple responses with
                  different time courses localized in VI, V2/3 and V5,
                  respectively. Supported by Grant-Aid from the

                  revisited. We emphasis the importance of information
                  fusion of various attributes of speeches (sounds) in
                  separating speeches from a mixture of sounds. This
                  emphasis is supported by comparing two methods of
                  speech separation; computational auditory scene
                  analysis approach that employs the attributes of
                  sound sources and sound transmitting channel, and
                  blind source separation approach that dispenses with
                  these attributes. Although these two approaches are
                  usually considered as opposite with regards to
                  whether sound attributes is used or not, we conclude
                  that they differ in the ways of using sound
                  attributes. Next, a new algorithm for information
                  fusion is proposed. Sound attributes extracted by
                  tracking harmonic structures and sound source
                  directions as well as by independent component
                  analysis are fused according to sound

                  to be very effective for binary classification. In

                  discuss the problem of combining binary classifiers
                  from the game-theoretical point of view. First, we
                  develop a general theorem for the condition of
                  minimaxity, which is closely related to the network
                  flow theory. Applying this theorem, we show that the

                  a graphical model, and the parameters are estimated

  abstract     = {(From ``introduction'') In this article, we first
                  review the EM algorithm from the geometrical
                  viewpoint based on the em algorithm proposed in
                  [7]. This geometrical concept is important to
                  interpret various learning rules in neural
                  networks. Then we give some examples of neural
                  network models in which the EM algorithm implicitly
                  appears in the learning process. From the biological
                  point of view, it is an important problem that the
                  EM algorithm can be appropriately implemented on
                  real biological systems. This is usually hard, and
                  with a special model, the Helmholtz machine, we
                  shortly discuss the tradeoff between statistical
                  models and biological models. In the end, we show
                  two models of neural networks in which the EM
                  algorithm is adopted for learning explicitly. These
                  models are proposed mainly for practical
                  applications, not for biological modeling, and they
                  are applied for complicated tasks such as
                  controlling robots.}

                  separation of acoustic signals in a reflective
                  environment. The first technique is the subspace
                  method which reduces the effect of room reflection
                  when the system is used in a room. Room reflection
                  is one of the biggest problems in blind source
                  separation (BSS) in acoustic environments. The
                  second technique is a method of solving
                  permutation. For employing the subspace method, ICA
                  must be used in the frequency domain, and precise
                  permutation is necessary for all frequencies. In
                  this method, a physical property of the mixing
                  matrix, i.e., the coherency in adjacent frequencies,
                  is utilized to solve the permutation. The
                  experiments in a meeting room showed that the
                  subspace method improved the rate of automatic
                  speech recognition from 50{\%} to 68{\%} and that
                  the method of solving permutation achieves
                  performance that closely approaches that of the
                  correct permutation, differing by only 4{\%} in

                  low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, with Pearl's

                  data. One of the successful applications is
                  neurobiological data analysis such as EEG
                  (electroencephalography), MRI (magnetic resonance
                  imaging), and MEG (magnetoencephalography). But
                  there remain a lot of problems. In most cases,

                  and the number of independent components is

                  separate noise-contaminated data without knowing the
                  number of independent components. A well-known two
                  stage approach to ICA is to pre-process the data by
                  PCA (principal component analysis), and then the
                  necessary rotation matrix is estimated. Since PCA
                  does not work well for noisy data, we implement a
                  factor analysis model for pre-processing. In the new
                  pre-processing, the number of the sources and the
                  amount of the sensory noise are estimated. After the
                  pre-processing, the rotation matrix is estimated

                  perception of motion from contour (CFM) have been
                  studied as difference between cortical responses to
                  segmented motion (SM) where random dots (RDs) in the
                  neighboring segments moved in the opposite direction
                  and homogenous motion (HM) where all RDs moved in
                  the same direction (Lamme et al., 1994). Using a
                  magnetometer-spatial filter system (Shimadzu
                  SBI-100) capable of resolving individual visual
                  cortical activities, we found similar CM signals
                  localized in human V2/3. The CM signals occurred
                  behind V5 responses, suggesting that CFM is
                  conducted in V2/3, instructed by global motion
                  signals detected in V5 and back-conveyed to V2/3
                  (Toyama et al., 1999). The present study reports two
                  findings supporting this view. First, a fine
                  parallelism was found between CM signals in V2/3 and
                  CFM determined by the forced choice estimate for
                  mixed SM (MSM) where SM was modified to contain
                  variable fractions (7-50\%) of oppositely moving
                  RDs. Visual stimuli were presented to the right
                  visual field of 7 male subjects, and MEGs were
                  recorded from the left occipital cortex. In all
                  subjects, CFM started to decrease with 10\% MSM and
                  reduced to 35\% with 40\% MSM. There was a
                  corresponding reduction (35\%) in CM signals in
                  V2/3. This parallelism was even preserved after
                  adaptation to HM (for 3min.). CFM decreased
                  dramatically after adaptation (65\% reduction for
                  40\% MSM), paralleled by a similar robust reduction
                  (35\%) of the CM signals. Second, there was also a
                  dramatic reduction of motion perception (80\% for
                  70\% MHM) for mixed HM (MHM) where HM was modified
                  to contain various fractions (70 -- 90\%) of
                  incoherent RD motion, and a reduction of V5 response
                  (40\%), but practically no reduction in V1 and V2/3
                  responses ($<$10\%). These findings support the
                  above view and further indicate that V5 is the
                  primary site for motion perception and adaptation.}

                  detector, i.e., an imager, is put at a slightly
                  out-of-focus position of the focusing mirror, rather
                  than just at the mirror focus, as in the standard
                  optics, to capture miniature images of objects. In
                  addition, a set of multi-grid masks (or a modulation
                  collimator) is installed in front of the
                  telescope. We find that the masks work as a coded
                  aperture camera and that they boost the angular
                  resolution of the focusing optics. The major
                  advantage of this concept is that a much better
                  angular resolution, having an order of 2--3 or more
                  than in the conventional optics, is achievable,
                  while a high throughput (large effective area) is
                  maintained, which is crucial in photon-limited
                  high-energy astronomy, because any type of mirrors,
                  including lightweight reflective mirrors, can be
                  employed in our concept. If the signal-to-noise
                  ratio is sufficiently high, we estimate that angular
                  resolutions at the diffraction limit of 4'' and
                  0.''4 at $\sim$7 keV can be achieved with a pair of
                  masks at distances of 1 m and 100 m, respectively.}

                  the large-scale cosmic matter
                  distribution. Widefield galaxy surveys allow us to
                  generate the so-called weak lensing maps, but actual
                  observations suffer from noise due to imperfect
                  measurement of galaxy shape distortions and to the
                  limited number density of the source galaxies. In
                  this paper, we explore a deep-learning approach to
                  reduce the noise. We develop an image-to-image
                  translation method with conditional adversarial
                  networks (CANs), which learn efficient mapping from
                  an input noisy weak lensing map to the underlying
                  noise field. We train the CANs using 30000 image
                  pairs obtained from 1000 ray-tracing simulations of
                  weak gravitational lensing. We show that the trained
                  CANs reproduce the true one-point probability
                  distribution function (PDF) of the noiseless lensing
                  map with a bias less than 1$\sigma$ on average,
                  where $\sigma$ is the statistical error. We perform
                  a Fisher analysis to make forecast for cosmological
                  parameter inference with the one-point lensing
                  PDF. By our denoising method using CANs, the first
                  derivative of the PDF with respect to the cosmic
                  mean matter density and the amplitude of the
                  primordial curvature perturbations becomes larger by
                  $\sim$ 50{\%}. This allows us to improve the
                  cosmological constraints by $\sim$ 30--40{\%} with
                  using observational data from ongoing and upcoming

                  detected meteors are 1514 and 706 on April 11 and

                  constrain the luminosity function of faint

                  masks in front of an X-ray mirror and an off-focused
                  two-dimensional imager. Because the obtained image
                  is off-focused, an additional image reconstruction
                  process is assumed to be included. Our image
                  reconstruction method is an extension of the
                  traditional Richardson-Lucy algorithm with two
                  regularization terms, one for sparseness and the
                  other for smoothness. Such a combination is
                  desirable for astronomical imaging because
                  astronomical objects have a variety in shape, from
                  point sources to diffuse sources to mixtures of
                  both. The performance of the system is demonstrated

                  X-ray sources such as Cas A and the Crab Nebula. The
                  image resolution is improved from a few arcmin of
                  focused image without the booster to a few arcsec
                  with the booster. Through the demonstration, the
                  angular resolution booster with the image
                  reconstruction method is shown to be feasible.}

                  is a procedure to convert linear polarization
                  spectra into the Faraday dispersion function, which
                  provides us with unique information of magneto-ionic
                  media along the line of sight. Mathematical
                  formulation of Faraday tomography is similar to
                  polarimetric imaging of radio interferometry, where
                  many new methods have been actively developed and
                  shown to outperform the standard CLEAN
                  approaches. In this paper, we propose a sparse
                  reconstruction technique to Faraday tomography. This
                  technique is being developed for interferometric
                  imaging and utilizes computationally less expensive
                  convex regularization functions such as -norm and
                  total variation (TV) or total squared variation
                  (TSV). The proposed technique solves a convex
                  optimization, and therefore its solution is
                  determined uniquely regardless of the initial
                  condition for given regularization parameters that
                  can be optimized by data themselves. Using a
                  physically-motivated model of turbulent galactic
                  magnetized plasma, we demonstrate that the proposed

                  developed based on the sparse modeling approach. It
                  has been implemented as a Python module operating on
                  Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) so
                  that the tool is able to process the data taken by
                  Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
                  (ALMA). In order to handle large data of ALMA, the
                  Fast Fourier Transform has been implemented with
                  gridding process. The concept of the sparse modeling
                  for the image reconstruction has been realized with
                  two regularization terms: L1 norm term for the
                  sparsity and Total Squared Variation (TSV) term for
                  the smoothness of the resulting image. Since it is
                  important to adjust the size of the regularization
                  terms appropriately, the cross-validation routine,
                  which is a standard method in statistics, has been
                  implemented. This imaging tool runs even on a
                  standard laptop PC and processes ALMA data within a
                  reasonable time. The interface of the tool is
                  comprehensible to CASA users and the usage is so
                  simple that it consists of mainly three steps to
                  obtain the result: an initialization, a
                  configuration, and a processing. Remarkable feature
                  of the tool is that it produces the solution without
                  human intervention. Furthermore, the solution is
                  robust in the sense that it is less affected by the
                  processing parameters. For the verification of the
                  imaging tool, we have tested it with two extreme
                  examples from ALMA Science Verification Data: the
                  protoplanetary disk, HL Tau as a typical smooth and
                  filled image, and the lensed galaxy, SDP.81 as a
                  sparse image. In our presentation, these results
                  will be presented with some performance
                  information. The comparison between our results and
                  those of traditional CLEAN method will also be
                  provided. Finally, our future improvement and
                  enhancement plan to make our tool competitive with
                  CLEAN will be shown.}

                  booster consists of double coded masks in front of
                  an X-ray mirror. In order to have a better sky image
                  from an off-focus image, a proper image
                  reconstruction process must be applied. The new
                  image reconstruction method is based on the Bayesian
                  statistics, where the traditional Richardson-Lucy
                  algorithm is extended with a prior of sparseness and
                  smoothness. Such a prior is desirable for
                  astronomical imaging because astronomical objects
                  have variety in shape from point sources, diffuse
                  sources (supernova remnants, clusters of galaxies,
                  and pulsar wind nebula) to mixtures of them (point
                  sources in Galactic planes). As a result, the image
                  resolution would be improved from a few arcmin to 10
                  arcsec. The performance of the X-ray telescope is
                  demonstrated with simulated data: point sources and
                  diffused X-ray sources such as Cas A and Crab
                  Nebula. Through the demonstration, the angular
                  resolution booster with the image reconstruction

                  with radio interferometers are crucial for
                  understanding the planet formation process. Recent
                  observations using Atacama Large
                  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have revealed
                  various small-scale structures in disks. In
                  interferometric observations, the observed data are
                  an incomplete set of Fourier components of the radio
                  source image. The image reconstruction is therefore
                  essential in obtaining the images in real space. The
                  CLEAN technique has been widely used, but recently,
                  a new technique using the sparse modeling approach
                  is suggested. This technique directly solves a set
                  of undetermined equations and has been shown to
                  behave better than the CLEAN technique based on mock
                  observations with VLBI (Very Long Baseline
                  Interferometry). However, it has never been applied
                  to ALMA-like connected interferometers nor real
                  observational data. In this work, for the first
                  time, the sparse modeling technique is applied to
                  observational data sets taken by ALMA. We evaluate
                  the performance of the technique by comparing the
                  resulting images with those derived by the CLEAN
                  technique. We use two sets of ALMA archival data at
                  Band 7 ($\sim$350 GHz) for the protoplanetary disk
                  around HD 142527. One is taken in the
                  intermediate-baseline array configuration, and the
                  other is in the longer-baseline array
                  configuration. The image resolutions reconstructed
                  from these data sets are different by a factor of
                  $\sim 3$. We compare images reconstructed using
                  sparse modeling and CLEAN. We find that the sparse
                  modeling technique can successfully reconstruct the
                  overall disk emission. The previously known disk
                  structures appear on both images made by the sparse
                  modeling and CLEAN at its nominal
                  resolutions. Remarkably, the image reconstructed
                  from intermediate-baseline data using the
                  sparse-modeling technique matches very well with
                  that obtained from longer-baseline data using the
                  CLEAN technique with the accuracy of $\sim 90$\% on
                  the image domain.}

                  function named total squared variation (TSV) of the
                  brightness distribution. First, we demonstrate that
                  our technique may achieve a superresolution of
                  $\sim30$\% compared with the traditional CLEAN beam
                  size using synthetic observations of two point
                  sources. Second, we present simulated observations
                  of three physically motivated static models of Sgr
                  A$^\ast$ with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to
                  show the performance of proposed techniques in
                  greater detail. Remarkably, in both the image and
                  gradient domains, the optimal beam size minimizing
                  root-mean-squared errors is $\le 10$\% of the
                  traditional CLEAN beam size for $\ell_1+$ TSV
                  regularization, and non-convolved reconstructed
                  images have smaller errors than beam-convolved
                  reconstructed images. This indicates that TSV is
                  well matched to the expected physical properties of
                  the astronomical images and the traditional
                  post-processing technique of Gaussian convolution in
                  interferometric imaging may not be required. We also
                  propose a feature-extraction method to detect
                  circular features from the image of a black hole
                  shadow and use it to evaluate the performance of the
                  image reconstruction. With this method and
                  reconstructed images, the EHT can constrain the
                  radius of the black hole shadow with an accuracy of
                  $\sim$ $10$\% -- $20$\% in present simulations for
                  Sgr A$^\ast$, suggesting that the EHT would be able
                  to provide useful independent measurements of the
                  mass of the supermassive black holes in Sgr A$^\ast$

                  alternative observing method, a ``slow-scanning''
                  observation. Images are continuously captured as
                  movie data, while the field of view is slowly
                  moved. The signal from an astronomical object is
                  extracted from the movie data by a low-rank and
                  sparse matrix decomposition. The performance of the
                  ``slow-scanning'' observation was tested in an
                  experimental observation with Subaru/COMICS. The
                  quality of a resultant image in the
                  ``slow-scanning'' observation was as good as in a
                  conventional chopping observation with COMICS, at
                  least for a bright point-source object. The
                  observational efficiency in the ``slow-scanning''
                  observation was better than that in the chopping
                  observation. The results suggest that the
                  ``slow-scanning'' observation can be a competitive
                  method for the Subaru telescope and be of potential
                  interest to other ground-based facilities to avoid
                  chopping.}

                  telescope of Kiso Observatory. Once full-scale
                  observation with the Tomo-e Gozen commences, it will
                  generate $\sim$ 30 TB of data per night. We
                  demonstrate that the data are compressed by a factor
                  of about 10 in size without losing transient events
                  like optical short transient point sources and
                  meteors. The intensity of point sources can be
                  recovered from the compressed data. The processing
                  runs sufficiently fast, compared with the expected
                  data-acquisition rate in the actual observing runs.}

                  functions and physical properties under
                  physiological conditions inside cells. In-cell NMR
                  provides data at atomic resolution non-invasively,
                  and has been used to detect protein-protein
                  interactions, thermodynamics of protein stability,
                  the behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins,
                  etc. in cells. However, so far only a single
                  {\itshape de novo} 3D protein structure could be
                  determined based on data derived only from in-cell
                  NMR. Here we introduce methods that enable in-cell

                  number of proteins at concentrations that approach
                  physiological ones. The new methods comprise (1)
                  advances in the processing of non-uniformly sampled
                  NMR data, which reduces the measurement time for the
                  intrinsically short-lived in-cell NMR samples, (2)
                  automatic chemical shift assignment for obtaining an
                  optimal resonance assignment, and (3) structure
                  refinement with Bayesian inference, which makes it
                  possible to calculate accurate 3D protein structures
                  from sparse data sets of conformational
                  restraints. As an example application we determined
                  the structure of the B1 domain of protein G at about
                  250 $\mu$M concentration in living {\itshape

                  explicit evaluation of the rate-distortion function
                  is not straightforward. We evaluate the
                  rate-distortion function for an independent
                  identically distributed gamma source with respect to
                  the absolute-log distortion measure. The logarithmic

                  to that under the absolute distortion
                  measure. Extending the explicit evaluation of the

                  we obtain the parametric form of the rate-distortion

                  reconstruction consists of a continuous component
                  enclosed by left and right discrete components, and
                  the left discrete component vanishes when the
                  acceptable distortion is small. We further extend
                  the result for a wider class of source

                  out, especially for faint objects, and (2) a

                  tool to investigate threedimensional (3D) structures
                  and dynamics of biomacromolecules at atomic
                  resolution in solution or more natural environments
                  such as living cells. Since NMR data are principally
                  only spectra with peak signals, it is required to
                  properly deduce structural information from the
                  sparse experimental data with their imperfections
                  and uncertainty, and to visualize 3D conformations
                  by NMR structure calculation. In order to
                  efficiently analyse the data, Rieping et
                  al. proposed a new structure calculation method
                  based on Bayes' theorem. We implemented a similar
                  approach into the program CYANA with some
                  modifications. It allows us to handle automatic NOE
                  cross peak assignments in unambiguous and ambiguous
                  usages, and to create a prior distribution based on
                  a physical force field with the generalized Born
                  implicit water model. The sampling scheme for
                  obtaining the posterior is performed by a hybrid
                  Monte Carlo algorithm combined with Markov chain
                  Monte Carlo (MCMC) by the Gibbs sampler, and
                  molecular dynamics simulation (MD) for obtaining a
                  canonical ensemble of conformations. Since it is not
                  trivial to search the entire function space
                  particularly for exploring the conformational prior
                  due to the extraordinarily large conformation space
                  of proteins, the replica exchange method is
                  performed, in which several MCMC calculations with
                  different temperatures run in parallel as
                  replicas. It is shown with simulated data or
                  randomly deleted experimental peaks that the new
                  structure calculation method can provide accurate
                  structures even with less peaks, especially compared
                  with the conventional method. In particular, it
                  dramatically improves in-cell structures of the

                  has been usually solved with 0 filling to un-sampled
                  grids. In this paper we propose to directly solve
                  this under-determined problem using sparse modeling
                  without 0 filling, which realizes super resolution,
                  i.e., resolution higher than the standard refraction
                  limit. We show simulation results of sparse modeling
                  for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations
                  of super-massive black holes and demonstrate that
                  our approach has significant merit in observations
                  of black hole shadows expected to be realized in
                  near future. We also present some results with the
                  method applied to real data, and also discuss more
                  advanced techniques for practical observations such
                  as imaging with closure phase as well as treating
                  the effect of interstellar scattering effect.}

  abstract     = {Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have an almost uniform
                  peak luminosity, so that they are used as ``standard
                  candle'' to estimate distances to galaxies in
                  cosmology. In this article, we introduce our two
                  recent works on SNIa based on data-driven
                  approach. The diversity in the peak luminosity of
                  SNIa can be reduced by corrections in several
                  variables. The color and decay rate have been used
                  as the explanatory variables of the peak luminosity
                  in past studies. However, it is proposed that their
                  spectral data could give a better model of the peak
                  luminosity. We use cross-validation in order to
                  control the generalization error and a LASSO-type
                  estimator in order to choose the set of
                  variables. Using 78 samples and 276 candidates of
                  variables, we confirm that the peak luminosity
                  depends on the color and decay rate. Our analysis
                  does not support adding any other variables in order
                  to have a better generalization error. On the other
                  hand, this analysis is based on the assumption that
                  SNIa originate in a single population, while it is
                  not trivial. Indeed, several sub-types possibly
                  having different nature have been proposed. We used
                  a visual analytics tool for the asymmetric
                  biclustering method to find both a good set of
                  variables and samples at the same time. Using 14
                  variables and 132 samples, we found that SNIa can be
                  divided into two categories by the expansion
                  velocity of ejecta. Those examples demonstrate that
                  the data-driven approach is useful for
                  high-dimensional large-volume data which becomes
                  common in modern astronomy.}

                  environmental studies; however, due to various
                  uncertainties and complexities present in data sets,
                  the standard generalized linear model with a
                  binomial error distribution often demonstrates
                  insufficient predictive performance when analysing
                  binary and proportional data. 2. To address this
                  difficulty, we propose an asymmetric logistic
                  regression model that uses a new parameter to
                  account for data complexity. We observe that this
                  parameter controls the model's asymmetry and is
                  important for adjusting the weights associated with
                  observed data in order to improve model
                  fitting. This model includes the ordinary logistic
                  regression model as a special case. It is easily
                  implemented using a slight modification of glm or
                  glmer in statistical software R. 3. Simulation
                  studies suggest that our new approach outperforms a
                  traditional approach in terms of both predictive
                  accuracy and variable selection. In a case study
                  involving fisheries data, we found that the annual
                  catch amount had a greater impact on stock status
                  prediction, and improved predictive capability was
                  supported with a smaller AIC compared to a
                  generalized linear model. 4. In summary, our method
                  can enhance the applicability of a generalized
                  linear model to various ecological problems using a
                  slight modification, and significantly improves
                  model fitting and model selection.}

                  communications. In order to transmit information
                  efficiently, digital wireless communication systems
                  choose the modulation scheme and coding
                  adaptively. This framework is called the adaptive
                  modulation and coding (AMC). The key problem of the
                  framework is how to design the switching
                  strategy. In this paper, we discuss the practical
                  strategy for AMC by comparing the channel capacity,
                  achievable rates with common modulation schemes, and
                  the actual rates with AMC. The channel capacity is
                  defined for a combination of the noisy channel and
                  the constraint on the information source. The noisy
                  channel we assume in this paper is the discrete-time
                  complex-valued additive white Gaussian noise channel
                  (AWGNC). For the constraint, we focus on the peak
                  power instead of the average power since a practical
                  communication transmitter often suffers from the
                  peak power. We compare the capacity and achievable
                  rates with practical modulation
                  schemes. Furthermore, we simulate AMC and evaluate
                  the actual rates numerically.}

                  incomplete and thus obtaining an image from observed
                  visibilities becomes an underdetermined problem, and
                  a technique of so-called ``zero-padding'' is often
                  used to fill up unsampled grids in the $(u,v)$
                  plane, resulting in image degradation by finite beam
                  size as well as numerous side-lobes. In this paper
                  we show that directly solving such an

                  this paper, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
                  Operator, known as LASSO) avoids the above problems

                  vertices and/or edges. The assumption is that the 
                  solution is built in several steps. In a given step, 
                  edges with successfully matched vertices are made 
                  permanent; but upon edge or vertex failures, the 
                  remaining vertices become eligible for reassignment. 
                  This process may be repeated a given number of times, 
                  and the objective is to end with the overall maximum 
                  number of matched vertices.
                  An application of this problem is found in kidney 
                  exchange programs, going on in several countries, 
                  where a vertex is an incompatible patient-donor pair

                  provides crucial information about the fundamental
                  physical processes in cataclysmic variables
                  (CVs). However, determining an appropriate
                  observation mode immediately after the discovery of
                  a new transient presents challenges due to
                  significant uncertainties regarding its nature. We
                  developed a framework designed for autonomous
                  decision making in prompt follow-up observations of
                  CVs using the Kanata $1.5\,m$ telescope. The system,
                  named Smart Kanata, first estimates the class
                  probabilities of variable star types using a
                  generative model. It then selects the optimal
                  observation mode from three possible options based
                  on the mutual information calculated from the class
                  probabilities. We have operated the system for
                  $\sim 300$ days and obtained 21 samples, among which
                  automated observations were successfully performed
                  for a nova and a microlensing event. In the
                  time-series spectra of the nova V4370 Oph, we
                  detected a rapid deepening of the absorption
                  component of the $H_\alpha$ line. These initial
                  results demonstrate the capability of Smart Kanata
                  in facilitating rapid observations and improving our
                  understanding of outbursts and eruptions of CVs and
                  other galactic transients.},

                  gravitational lensing observations of distant
                  galaxies (weak lensing mass maps). We construct the
                  model based on a neural style transfer so that it
                  can transform Gaussian weak lensing mass maps into
                  deeply non-Gaussian counterparts as predicted in
                  ray-tracing lensing simulations.  We develop an
                  unpaired image-to-image translation method with
                  Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks
                  (Cycle GAN), which learn efficient mapping from an
                  input domain to a target domain. Our model is
                  designed to enjoy important advantages; it is
                  trainable with no need for paired simulation data,
                  flexible to make the input domain visually
                  meaningful, and expandable to rapidly-produce a map
                  with a larger sky coverage than training data
                  without additional learning. Using 10,000 lensing
                  simulations, we find that appropriate labeling of
                  training data based on field variance allows the
                  model to reproduce a correct scatter in summary
                  statistics for weak lensing mass maps. Compared with
                  a popular log-normal model, our model improves in
                  predicting the statistical natures of three-point
                  correlations and local properties of rare
                  high-density regions. We also demonstrate that our
                  model enables us to produce a continuous map with a
                  sky coverage of $\sim166\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ but
                  similar non-Gaussian features to training data
                  covering $\sim12\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ in a GPU minute.
                  Hence, our model can be beneficial to massive
                  productions of synthetic weak lensing mass maps,

                  majorization-minimization Bregman proximal gradient
                  algorithm (MMBPG) and MMBPG with extrapolation
                  (MMBPGe). MMBPG and MMBPGe minimize an auxiliary
                  function majorizing the Kullback--Leibler (KL)
                  divergence loss by the existing Bregman proximal
                  gradient algorithms. While existing KL-based NMF
                  methods update each variable alternately, proposed
                  algorithms update all variables simultaneously. The
                  proposed MMBPG and MMBPGe are equipped with a

                  adaptable property and that makes its subproblem

                  disks are spatially resolved, with the radii ranging

                  of the disks harbor clear gap structures, whose
                  radial locations show a bimodal distribution with

                  see structures indicating weak gaps at all the radii
                  in the disk. We find that the widths of these gaps
                  increase with their depths, which is consistent with
                  the model of planet-disk interactions. The inferred
                  planet mass-orbital radius distribution indicates
                  that the planet distribution is analogous to our
                  Solar System. However, planets with Neptune mass or
                  lower may exist in all the radii.},

                  original signal without knowing a convolving
                  filter. It is naturally formulated as a minimization
                  of a quartic objective function under some
                  assumption. Because its differentiable part does not
                  have a Lipschitz continuous gradient, existing
                  first-order methods are not theoretically
                  supported. In this paper, we employ the
                  Bregman-based proximal methods, whose convergence is
                  theoretically guaranteed under the $L$-smooth
                  adaptable ($L$-smad) property. We first reformulate
                  the objective function as a difference of convex
                  (DC) functions and apply the Bregman proximal DC
                  algorithm (BPDCA). This DC decomposition satisfies
                  the $L$-smad property. The method is extended to the
                  BPDCA with extrapolation (BPDCAe) for faster
                  convergence. When our regularizer has a sufficiently
                  simple structure, each iteration is solved in a
                  closed-form expression, and thus our algorithms
                  solve large-scale problems efficiently. We also
                  provide the stability analysis of the equilibriums
                  and demonstrate the proposed methods through
                  numerical experiments on image deblurring. The
                  results show that BPDCAe successfully recovered the
                  original image and outperformed other existing
                  algorithms.},

                  Array (ALMA) observations, compact protoplanetary
                  disks with dust radii of $r \lesssim 20$ -- $40 au$
                  were found to be dominant in nearby low-mass star
                  formation regions. However, their substructures have
                  not been investigated because of the limited spatial
                  resolution achieved so far. We apply a newly
                  developed super-resolution imaging technique
                  utilizing sparse modeling (SpM) to explore several
                  au-scale structures in such compact disks. SpM
                  imaging can directly solve for the incomplete
                  sampling of visibilities in the spatial frequency
                  and potentially improve the fidelity and effective
                  spatial resolution of ALMA images. Here we present
                  the results of the application to the T Tau
                  system. We use the ALMA $1.3 mm$ continuum data and
                  achieve an effective spatial resolution of
                  $\sim$30\% ($5 au$) compared with the conventional
                  CLEAN beam size at a resolution of $17 au$. The
                  reconstructed image reveals a new annular gap
                  structure at $r = 12 au$ in the T Tau N compact
                  disk, with a dust radius of $24 au$, and resolves
                  the T Tau Sa and Sb binary into two sources. If the
                  observed gap structure in the T Tau N disk is caused
                  by an embedded planet, we estimate a Saturn-mass
                  planet when the viscous parameter of the disk is
                  $10^{-3}$. Ultimately, ALMA observations with enough
                  angular resolution and sensitivity should be able to
                  verify the consistency of the super-resolution
                  imaging and definitely confirm the existence of this

                  contribution from the Earth's atmosphere and the
                  instrument is essential. For this purpose, here we
                  propose a new method based on a data-scientific
                  approach. The key technique is statistical matrix
                  decomposition that automatically separates the
                  signals of astronomical emission lines from the
                  drift noise components in the fast-sampled (1--10
                  Hz) time-series spectra obtained by a
                  position-switching (PSW) observation. Because the
                  proposed method does not apply subtraction between
                  two sets of noisy data (i.e., on-source and
                  off-source spectra), it improves the observation
                  sensitivity by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. It also
                  reduces artificial signals such as baseline ripples
                  on a spectrum, which may also help to improve the
                  effective sensitivity. We demonstrate this
                  improvement by using the spectroscopic data of
                  emission lines toward a high-redshift galaxy
                  observed with a 2\,mm receiver on the 50\,m Large
                  Millimeter Telescope. Since the proposed method is
                  carried out offline and no additional measurements
                  are required, it offers an instant improvement on
                  the spectra reduced so far with the conventional
                  method. It also enables efficient deep spectroscopy
                  driven by the future 50\,m class large submillimeter
                  single-dish telescopes, where fast PSW observations
                  by mechanical antenna or mirror drive are difficult

                  an adaptive LASSO algorithm to perform a

                  the underlying cosmic density field is represented
                  by a sum of Navarro--Frenk--White halos. We generate
                  realistic mock galaxy shear catalogs by considering
                  the shear distortions from isolated halos for the
                  configurations matched to the Subaru Hyper

                  variation components when the objects are in the
                  hard state. In the case of the black hole X-ray
                  binary, {GX} 339-4, the cross correlation function
                  ({CCF}) of the light curves suggests a positive
                  correlation with an optical lag of 0.15 s and
                  anti-correlations with an optical lag of 1 s and
                  X-ray lag of 4 s. This indicates the two light
                  curves have some common signal components with
                  different delays. In this study, we extracted and
                  reconstructed those signal components from the data
                  for {GX} 339-4. The results confirmed that
                  correlation and anti-correlation with the optical

                  that the reconstructed light curve for the
                  anti-correlated component indicates a positively
                  correlated variation with an X-ray lag of $\sim$
                  $+$1 s. In addition, the {CCF} for this signal
                  component shows anti-correlations not only with the
                  optical lag, but also with the X-ray lag, which is
                  consistent with the {CCF} for the data. Therefore,
                  our results suggest that the combination of the two
                  positively correlated components, that is, the X-ray
                  preceding signal with the 0.15-s optical lag and the
                  optical preceding signal with the 1-s X-ray lag, can
                  make the observed {CCF} without anti-correlated
                  signals. The optical preceding signal may be caused
                  by synchrotron emission in a magnetically dominated
                  accretion flow or in a jet, while further study is
                  required to understand the mechanism of the X-ray

                  (OU) process, and investigate the features that are
                  discriminative for the two subtypes. We used optical
                  photometric and polarimetric data obtained with the
                  1.5-m Kanata telescope for 2008-2014. We found that
                  four features, namely the variation amplitude,
                  characteristic timescale, and non-stationarity of
                  the variability obtained from the light curves and
                  the median of the degree of polarization (PD), are
                  essential for distinguishing between FSRQs and BL
                  Lac objects. FSRQs are characterized by rare and
                  large flares, while the variability of BL Lac
                  objects can be reproduced with a stationary OU
                  process with relatively small amplitudes. The
                  characteristics of the variability are governed not
                  by the differences in the jet structure between the
                  subtypes, but by the peak frequency of the
                  synchrotron emission. This implies that the nature
                  of the variation in the jets is common in FSRQs and
                  BL Lac objects. We found that BL Lac objects tend to
                  have high PD medians, which suggests that they have
                  a stable polarization component. FSRQs have no such
                  component, possibly because of a strong Compton
                  cooling effect in sub-pc scale jets.},

                  axes. Specifically, we apply the Kuiper test to
                  examine the statistical uniformity of the position
                  angle (PA: the angle of the major axis of the
                  projected disk ellipse measured counterclockwise

                  the star-forming regions, except the Lupus clouds,
                  do not show any signature of the alignment,
                  supporting the random orientation. Rotational axes
                  of 16 disks with spectroscopic measurement of PA in
                  the Lupus III cloud, a subregion of the Lupus field,

                  the random distribution at a 2$\sigma$ level, and
                  the inclination angles of the 16 disks are not
                  uniform as well. Furthermore, the mean direction of
                  the disk PAs in the Lupus III cloud is parallel to
                  the direction of its filament structure and
                  approximately perpendicular to the magnetic field
                  direction. We also confirm the robustness of the
                  estimated PAs in the Lupus clouds by comparing the
                  different observations and estimators based on three

                  absence of the significant alignment of the disk
                  orientation is consistent with the turbulent origin
                  of the disk angular momentum. Further observations

                  meteors are important to understand the size
                  distribution of the interplanetary dust. However,
                  faint meteors detected by high power large aperture
                  radar observations, which are typically as faint as
                  10 mag. In optical, have not been detected until
                  recently in optical observations, mainly due to
                  insufficient sensitivity of the optical
                  observations. In this paper, two radar and optical
                  simultaneous observations were organized. The first
                  observation was carried out in 2009-2010 using
                  Middle and Upper Atmosphere Radar (MU radar) and an
                  image-intensified CCD camera. The second observation
                  was carried out in 2018 using the MU radar and a
                  mosaic CMOS camera, Tomo-e Gozen, mounted on the
                  1.05-m Kiso Schmidt Telescope. In total, 331
                  simultaneous meteors were detected. The relationship
                  between radar cross sections and optical V-band
                  magnitudes was well approximated by a linear
                  function. A transformation function from the radar
                  cross section to the V-band magnitude was derived
                  for sporadic meteors. The transformation function
                  was applied to about 150,000 meteors detected by the
                  MU radar in 2009-2015, large part of which are
                  sporadic, and a luminosity function was derived in
                  the magnitude range of $-1.5\sim 9.5$mag . The
                  luminosity function was well approximated by a
                  single power-law function with the population index
                  of $r=3.52\pm 0.12$. The present observation
                  indicates that the MU radar has capability to detect
                  interplanetary dust of $10^{-5}$ -- $10^0$g in mass
                  as meteors.},

                  protoplanetary disks. In this study, sparse modeling
                  (SpM) is applied for the first time to observational
                  data sets taken by the Atacama Large
                  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The two data
                  sets used in this study were taken independently
                  using different array configurations at Band 7 (330
                  GHz), targeting the protoplanetary disk around HD
                  142527: one in the shorter-baseline array
                  configuration ($\sim$430 m), and the other in the
                  longer-baseline array configuration ($\sim$1570
                  m). The image resolutions reconstructed from the two
                  data sets are different by a factor of $\sim$3. We
                  confirm that the previously known disk structures
                  appear on the images produced by both SpM and CLEAN
                  at the standard beam size. The image reconstructed
                  from the shorter-baseline data using the SpM matches
                  that obtained with the longer-baseline data using
                  the CLEAN, achieving a super-resolution image from
                  which a structure finer than the beam size can be
                  reproduced. Our results demonstrate that ongoing
                  intensive development in the SpM imaging technique
                  is beneficial to imaging with ALMA.},

                  stable-isotope-assisted parameter extraction
                  (SiPex), to resolve overlapping signals by a
                  combination of amino-acid selective isotope labeling
                  (AASIL) and tensor decomposition. The basic idea of
                  Sipex is that overlapping signals can be decomposed
                  with the help of intensity patterns derived from
                  quantitative fractional AASIL, which also provides
                  amino-acid information. In SiPex, spectra for
                  protein characterization, such as 15N relaxation
                  measurements, are assembled with those for
                  amino-acid information to form a four-order tensor,
                  where the intensity patterns from AASIL contribute
                  to high decomposition performance even if the
                  signals share similar chemical shift values or
                  characterization profiles, such as relaxation
                  curves. The loading vectors of each decomposed
                  component, corresponding to an amide group,
                  represent both the amino-acid and relaxation
                  information. This information link provides an
                  alternative protein analysis method that does not
                  require ``assignments'' in a general sense; i.e.,
                  chemical shift determinations, since the amino-acid
                  information for some of the residues allows
                  unambiguous assignment according to the dual
                  selective labeling. SiPex can also decompose signals
                  in time-domain raw data without Fourier transform,
                  even in non-uniformly sampled data without spectral
                  reconstruction. These features of SiPex should
                  expand biological NMR applications by overcoming
                  their overlapping and assignment problems.},

  abstract     = {The Event Horizon Telescope observed the
                  horizon-scale synchrotron emission region around the
                  Galactic center supermassive black hole, Sagittarius
                  A$^{\ast}$ (\sgrabib), in 2017. These
                  observations revealed a bright, thick ring
                  morphology with a diameter of $51.8\pm 2.3$ \uasbib
                  and modest azimuthal brightness asymmetry,
                  consistent with the expected appearance of a black
                  hole with mass $M \simeq 10^6$\solarmassbib. From
                  these observations, we present the first resolved
                  linear and circular polarimetric images of Sgr
                  A*. The linear polarization images demonstrate that
                  the emission ring is highly polarized, exhibiting a
                  prominent spiral electric vector polarization angle
                  pattern with a peak fractional polarization of
                  $\sim$40\% in the western portion of the ring. The
                  circular polarization images feature a modestly
                  ($\sim 5\% - 10\%$) polarized dipole structure along
                  the emission ring, with negative circular
                  polarization in the western region and positive
                  circular polarization in the eastern region,
                  although our methods exhibit stronger disagreement
                  than for linear polarization. We analyze the data
                  using multiple independent imaging and modeling
                  methods, each of which is validated using a
                  standardized suite of synthetic data sets. While the
                  detailed spatial distribution of the linear
                  polarization along the ring remains uncertain owing
                  to the intrinsic variability of the source, the
                  spiraling polarization structure is robust to
                  methodological choices. The degree and orientation
                  of the linear polarization provide stringent
                  constraints for the black hole and its surrounding
                  magnetic fields, which we discuss in an accompanying
                  publication.}

  abstract     = {In a companion paper, we present the first spatially
                  resolved polarized image of Sagittarius A* on event
                  horizon scales, captured using the Event Horizon
                  Telescope, a global very long baseline
                  interferometric array operating at a wavelength of
                  1.3 mm. Here we interpret this image using both
                  simple analytic models and numerical general
                  relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)
                  simulations. The large spatially resolved linear
                  polarization fraction ($24\% - 28\%$, peaking at
                  $\sim 40\%$) is the most stringent constraint on
                  parameter space, disfavoring models that are too
                  Faraday depolarized. Similar to our studies of
                  M87$^\ast$, polarimetric constraints reinforce a
                  preference for GRMHD models with dynamically
                  important magnetic fields. Although the spiral
                  morphology of the polarization pattern is known to
                  constrain the spin and inclination angle, the
                  time-variable rotation measure (RM) of \sgrabib
                  (equivalent to $\simeq 46^\circ \pm 12^\circ$
                  rotation at 228 GHz) limits its present utility as a
                  constraint. If we attribute the RM to internal
                  Faraday rotation, then the motion of accreting
                  material is inferred to be counterclockwise,
                  contrary to inferences based on historical polarized
                  flares, and no model satisfies all polarimetric and
                  total intensity constraints. On the other hand, if
                  we attribute the mean RM to an external Faraday
                  screen, then the motion of accreting material is
                  inferred to be clockwise, and one model passes all
                  applied total intensity and polarimetric
                  constraints: a model with strong magnetic fields, a
                  spin parameter of 0.94, and an inclination of
                  150$^\circ$. We discuss how future 345 GHz and
                  dynamical imaging will mitigate our present
                  uncertainties and provide additional constraints on
                  the black hole and its accretion flow.}

  abstract     = {In April 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)
                  Collaboration reported the first-ever
                  event-horizon-scale images of a black hole,
                  resolving the central compact radio source in the
                  giant elliptical galaxy M87. These images reveal a
                  ring with a southerly brightness distribution and a
                  diameter of $\sim$ 42\uasbib, consistent with the
                  predicted size and shape of a shadow produced by the
                  gravitationally lensed emission around a
                  supermassive black hole. These results were obtained
                  as part of the April 2017 EHT observation campaign,
                  using a global very long baseline interferometric
                  radio array operating at a wavelength of
                  1.3\,mm. Here, we present results based on the
                  second EHT observing campaign, taking place in April
                  2018 with an improved array, wider frequency
                  coverage, and increased bandwidth.  In particular,
                  the additional baselines provided by the Greenland
                  telescope improved the coverage of the
                  array. Multiyear EHT observations provide
                  independent snapshots of the horizon-scale emission,
                  allowing us to confirm the persistence, size, and
                  shape of the black hole shadow, and constrain the
                  intrinsic structural variability of the accretion
                  flow. We have confirmed the presence of an
                  asymmetric ring structure, brighter in the
                  southwest, with a median diameter of
                  $43.3_{-3.1}^{+1.5}$ \uasbib. The diameter of the 2018
                  ring is remarkably consistent with the diameter
                  obtained from the previous 2017 observations. On the
                  other hand, the position angle of the brightness
                  asymmetry in 2018 is shifted by about 30$^\circ$
                  relative to 2017. The perennial persistence of the
                  ring and its diameter robustly support the
                  interpretation that the ring is formed by lensed
                  emission surrounding a Kerr black hole with a mass
                  $\sim 6.5\times 10^{9}$\solarmassbib. The significant change
                  in the ring brightness asymmetry implies a spin axis
                  that is more consistent with the position angle of
                  the large-scale jet.}

  abstract     = {Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations have
                  revealed a bright ring of emission around the
                  supermassive black hole at the center of the M87
                  galaxy. EHT images in linear polarization have
                  further identified a coherent spiral pattern around
                  the black hole, produced from ordered magnetic
                  fields threading the emitting plasma. Here we
                  present the first analysis of circular polarization
                  using EHT data, acquired in 2017, which can
                  potentially provide additional insights into the
                  magnetic fields and plasma composition near the
                  black hole. Interferometric closure quantities
                  provide convincing evidence for the presence of
                  circularly polarized emission on event-horizon
                  scales. We produce images of the circular
                  polarization using both traditional and newly
                  developed methods. All methods find a moderate level
                  of resolved circular polarization across the image
                  ($<|v|>\ge 3.7\%$), consistent
                  with the low image-integrated circular polarization
                  fraction measured by the Atacama Large
                  Millimeter/submillimeter Array ($|v_{int}|\ge
                  1\%$). Despite this broad agreement, the methods
                  show substantial variation in the morphology of the
                  circularly polarized emission, indicating that our
                  conclusions are strongly dependent on the imaging
                  assumptions because of the limited baseline
                  coverage, uncertain telescope gain calibration, and
                  weakly polarized signal. We include this upper limit
                  in an updated comparison to general relativistic
                  magnetohydrodynamic simulation models. This analysis
                  reinforces the previously reported preference for
                  magnetically arrested accretion flow models. We find
                  that most simulations naturally produce a low level
                  of circular polarization consistent with our upper
                  limit and that Faraday conversion is likely the
                  dominant production mechanism for circular
                  polarization at 230 GHz in M87$^\ast$.}

  abstract     = {We present the first Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)
                  observations of Sagittarius A{$^\ast$} (Sgr
                  A{$^\ast$}), the Galactic center source associated
                  with a supermassive black hole. These observations
                  were conducted in 2017 using a global
                  interferometric array of eight telescopes operating
                  at a wavelength of $\lambda=1.3$mm. The EHT data
                  resolve a compact emission region with intrahour
                  variability. A variety of imaging and modeling
                  analyses all support an image that is dominated by a
                  bright, thick ring with a diameter of 51.8$\pm{2.3}
                  $\uasbib (68\% credible interval). The ring has
                  modest azimuthal brightness asymmetry and a
                  comparatively dim interior. Using a large suite of
                  numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the EHT
                  images of \sgrabib are consistent with the
                  expected appearance of a Kerr black hole with mass
                  $\sim 4\times 10^6$ \solarmassbib, which is inferred to
                  exist at this location based on previous infrared
                  observations of individual stellar orbits, as well
                  as maser proper-motion studies. Our model
                  comparisons disfavor scenarios where the black hole
                  is viewed at high inclination ($i>50^\circ$), as
                  well as nonspinning black holes and those with
                  retrograde accretion disks. Our results provide
                  direct evidence for the presence of a supermassive
                  black hole at the center of the Milky Way, and for
                  the first time we connect the predictions from
                  dynamical measurements of stellar orbits on scales
                  of 103--105 gravitational radii to
                  event-horizon-scale images and
                  variability. Furthermore, a comparison with the EHT
                  results for the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$
                  shows consistency with the predictions of general
                  relativity spanning over three orders of magnitude
                  in central mass.}

  abstract     = {We present Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) 1.3 mm
                  measurements of the radio source located at the
                  position of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius
                  A$^\ast$ (\sgrabib), collected during the 2017
                  April 5--11 campaign. The observations were carried
                  out with eight facilities at six locations across
                  the globe. Novel calibration methods are employed to
                  account for \sgrabib's flux variability. The
                  majority of the 1.3 mm emission arises from horizon
                  scales, where intrinsic structural source
                  variability is detected on timescales of minutes to
                  hours. The effects of interstellar scattering on the
                  image and its variability are found to be
                  subdominant to intrinsic source structure. The
                  calibrated visibility amplitudes, particularly the
                  locations of the visibility minima, are broadly
                  consistent with a blurred ring with a diameter of
                  $\sim$50\uasbib, as determined in later works in
                  this series. Contemporaneous multiwavelength
                  monitoring of \sgrabib was performed at 22, 43,
                  and 86 GHz and at near-infrared and X-ray
                  wavelengths. Several X-ray flares from \sgrabib are
                  detected by Chandra, one at low significance jointly
                  with Swift on 2017 April 7 and the other at higher
                  significance jointly with NuSTAR on 2017 April
                  11. The brighter April 11 flare is not observed
                  simultaneously by the EHT but is followed by a
                  significant increase in millimeter flux variability
                  immediately after the X-ray outburst, indicating a
                  likely connection in the emission physics near the
                  event horizon. We compare \sgrabib's broadband
                  flux during the EHT campaign to its historical
                  spectral energy distribution and find that both the
                  quiescent emission and flare emission are consistent
                  with its long-term behavior.}

 abstract      = {We present the first event-horizon-scale images and
                  spatiotemporal analysis of \sgrabib taken with
                  the Event Horizon Telescope in 2017 April at a
                  wavelength of 1.3 mm. Imaging of \sgrabib has
                  been conducted through surveys over a wide range of
                  imaging assumptions using the classical CLEAN
                  algorithm, regularized maximum likelihood methods,
                  and a Bayesian posterior sampling method. Different
                  prescriptions have been used to account for
                  scattering effects by the interstellar medium toward
                  the Galactic center. Mitigation of the rapid
                  intraday variability that characterizes Sgr
                  A$^{\ast}$ has been carried out through the addition
                  of a ``variability noise budget'' in the observed
                  visibilities, facilitating the reconstruction of
                  static full-track images. Our static reconstructions
                  of \sgrabib can be clustered into four
                  representative morphologies that correspond to ring
                  images with three different azimuthal brightness
                  distributions and a small cluster that contains
                  diverse nonring morphologies. Based on our extensive
                  analysis of the effects of sparse $(u, v)$-coverage,
                  source variability, and interstellar scattering, as
                  well as studies of simulated visibility data, we
                  conclude that the Event Horizon Telescope Sgr
                  A$^{\ast}$ data show compelling evidence for an
                  image that is dominated by a bright ring of emission
                  with a ring diameter of $\sim$50\uasbib, consistent
                  with the expected ``shadow'' of a $4\times 10^{6}$
                  \solarmassbib black hole in the Galactic center located
                  at a distance of 8 kpc.}

  abstract     = {In this paper we quantify the temporal variability
                  and image morphology of the horizon-scale emission
                  from \sgrabib, as observed by the EHT in 2017
                  April at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. We find that the
                  \sgrabib data exhibit variability that exceeds
                  what can be explained by the uncertainties in the
                  data or by the effects of interstellar
                  scattering. The magnitude of this variability can be
                  a substantial fraction of the correlated flux
                  density, reaching $\sim 100\%$ on some
                  baselines. Through an exploration of simple
                  geometric source models, we demonstrate that
                  ringlike morphologies provide better fits to the Sgr
                  A$^\ast$ data than do other morphologies with
                  comparable complexity. We develop two strategies for
                  fitting static geometric ring models to the
                  time-variable \sgrabib data; one strategy fits
                  models to short segments of data over which the
                  source is static and averages these independent
                  fits, while the other fits models to the full data
                  set using a parametric model for the structural
                  variability power spectrum around the average source
                  structure. Both geometric modeling and image-domain
                  feature extraction techniques determine the ring
                  diameter to be $51.8\pm 2.3$\uasbib (68\% credible
                  intervals), with the ring thickness constrained to
                  have an FWHM between $\sim$30\% and 50\% of the ring
                  diameter. To bring the diameter measurements to a
                  common physical scale, we calibrate them using
                  synthetic data generated from GRMHD
                  simulations. This calibration constrains the angular
                  size of the gravitational radius to be
                  $4.8_{-0.7}^{+1.4}$\uasbib, which we combine with an
                  independent distance measurement from maser
                  parallaxes to determine the mass of \sgrabib to
                  be $4.0_{-0.6}^{+1.1}\times 10^{6}$ \solarmassbib.}

  abstract     = {In this paper we provide a first physical
                  interpretation for the Event Horizon Telescope's
                  (EHT) 2017 observations of \sgrabib. Our main
                  approach is to compare resolved EHT data at 230 GHz
                  and unresolved non-EHT observations from radio to
                  X-ray wavelengths to predictions from a library of
                  models based on time-dependent general relativistic
                  magnetohydrodynamics simulations, including aligned,
                  tilted, and stellar-wind-fed simulations; radiative
                  transfer is performed assuming both thermal and
                  nonthermal electron distribution functions. We test
                  the models against 11 constraints drawn from EHT
                  230GHz data and observations at 86GHz, 2.2$\mu$m,
                  and in the X-ray. All models fail at least one
                  constraint. Light-curve variability provides a
                  particularly severe constraint, failing nearly all
                  strongly magnetized (magnetically arrested disk
                  (MAD)) models and a large fraction of weakly
                  magnetized models. A number of models fail only the
                  variability constraints. We identify a promising
                  cluster of these models, which are MAD and have
                  inclination $i\le 30^\circ$. They have accretion
                  rate $(5.2-9.5) \times 10^{-9}$\solarmassbib yr$^{-1}$,
                  bolometric luminosity $(6.8-9.2) \times 1035$ erg
                  s$^{-1}$, and outflow power $(1.3-4.8) \times 1038$
                  erg s$^{-1}$. We also find that all models with $i
                  \ge 70^{\circ}$ fail at least two constraints, as do
                  all models with equal ion and electron temperature;
                  exploratory, nonthermal model sets tend to have
                  higher 2.2 $\mu$m flux density; and the population
                  of cold electrons is limited by X-ray constraints
                  due to the risk of bremsstrahlung
                  overproduction. Finally, we discuss physical and
                  numerical limitations of the models, highlighting
                  the possible importance of kinetic effects and
                  duration of the simulations.}

  abstract     = {Astrophysical black holes are expected to be
                  described by the Kerr metric. This is the only
                  stationary, vacuum, axisymmetric metric, without
                  electromagnetic charge, that satisfies Einstein's
                  equations and does not have pathologies outside of
                  the event horizon. We present new constraints on
                  potential deviations from the Kerr prediction based
                  on 2017 EHT observations of Sagittarius A$^{\ast}$
                  (\sgrabib). We calibrate the relationship
                  between the geometrically defined black hole shadow
                  and the observed size of the ring-like images using
                  a library that includes both Kerr and non-Kerr
                  simulations. We use the exquisite prior constraints
                  on the mass-to-distance ratio for \sgrabib to
                  show that the observed image size is within
                  $\sim$10\% of the Kerr predictions. We use these
                  bounds to constrain metrics that are parametrically
                  different from Kerr, as well as the charges of
                  several known spacetimes. To consider alternatives
                  to the presence of an event horizon, we explore the
                  possibility that \sgrabib is a compact object
                  with a surface that either absorbs and thermally
                  reemits incident radiation or partially reflects
                  it. Using the observed image size and the broadband
                  spectrum of \sgrabib, we conclude that a
                  thermal surface can be ruled out and a fully
                  reflective one is unlikely. We compare our results
                  to the broader landscape of gravitational
                  tests. Together with the bounds found for
                  stellar-mass black holes and the M87 black hole, our
                  observations provide further support that the
                  external spacetimes of all black holes are described
                  by the Kerr metric, independent of their mass.}

  abstract     =  {Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations at 230
                  GHz have now imaged polarized emission around the
                  supermassive black hole in M87 on event-horizon
                  scales. This polarized synchrotron radiation probes
                  the structure of magnetic fields and the plasma
                  properties near the black hole. Here we compare the
                  resolved polarization structure observed by the EHT,
                  along with simultaneous unresolved observations with
                  the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, to
                  expectations from theoretical models. The low
                  fractional linear polarization in the resolved image
                  suggests that the polarization is scrambled on
                  scales smaller than the EHT beam, which we attribute
                  to Faraday rotation internal to the emission
                  region. We estimate the average density $n_e \sim
                  10^{4-7}$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, magnetic field strength
                  $B \sim 1-30$\,G, and electron temperature $T_e \sim
                  (1-12) \times 10^{10}$\,K of the radiating plasma in
                  a simple one-zone emission model. We show that the
                  net azimuthal linear polarization pattern may result
                  from organized, poloidal magnetic fields in the
                  emission region. In a quantitative comparison with a
                  large library of simulated polarimetric images from
                  general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)
                  simulations, we identify a subset of physical models
                  that can explain critical features of the
                  polarimetric EHT observations while producing a
                  relativistic jet of sufficient power. The consistent
                  GRMHD models are all of magnetically arrested
                  accretion disks, where near-horizon magnetic fields
                  are dynamically important. We use the models to
                  infer a mass accretion rate onto the black hole in
                  M87 of $(3-20) \times 10^{-4}$\solarmassbib\,yr$^{-1}$.}

                  morphology. This structure originates from
                  synchrotron emission produced by relativistic plasma
                  located in the immediate vicinity of the black
                  hole. Here we present the corresponding
                  linear-polarimetric EHT images of the center of
                  M87. We find that only a part of the ring is
                  significantly polarized. The resolved fractional
                  linear polarization has a maximum located in the
                  southwest part of the ring, where it rises to the
                  level of $\sim 15\%$. The polarization position
                  angles are arranged in a nearly azimuthal
                  pattern. We perform quantitative measurements of
                  relevant polarimetric properties of the compact
                  emission and find evidence for the temporal
                  evolution of the polarized source structure over one
                  week of EHT observations. The details of the
                  polarimetric data reduction and calibration
                  methodology are provided. We carry out the data
                  analysis using multiple independent imaging and
                  modeling techniques, each of which is validated
                  against a suite of synthetic data sets. The gross
                  polarimetric structure and its apparent evolution
                  with time are insensitive to the method used to
                  reconstruct the image. These polarimetric images
                  carry information about the structure of the
                  magnetic fields responsible for the synchrotron
                  emission. Their physical interpretation is discussed
                  in an accompanying publication.}

  abstract     = {When surrounded by a transparent emission region,
                  black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow
                  caused by gravitational light bending and photon
                  capture at the event horizon. To image and study
                  this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon
                  Telescope, a global very long baseline
                  interferometry array observing at a wavelength of
                  $1.3$ mm. This allows us to reconstruct
                  event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black
                  hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical
                  galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact
                  radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring
                  with a diameter of $42\pm 3$ micro-as, which is
                  circular and encompasses a central depression in
                  brightness with a flux ratio
                  $\gtrsim 10:1$. The emission ring is recovered using
                  different calibration and imaging schemes, with its
                  diameter and width remaining stable over four
                  different observations carried out in different
                  days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with
                  expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as
                  predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in
                  brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of
                  relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma
                  rotating close to the speed of light around a black
                  hole. We compare our images to an extensive library
                  of ray-traced general-relativistic
                  magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and
                  derive a central mass of $M = (6.5\pm 0.7) \times
                  10^9$\solarmassbib. Our radio-wave observations thus
                  provide powerful evidence for the presence of
                  supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and
                  as the central engines of active galactic
                  nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore
                  gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass
                  scale that was so far not accessible.}

  abstract     = {The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a very long
                  baseline interferometry (VLBI) array that comprises
                  millimeter- and submillimeter-wavelength telescopes
                  separated by distances comparable to the diameter of
                  the Earth. At a nominal operating wavelength of
                  $\sim 1.3$ mm, EHT angular resolution ($\lambda/D$)
                  is $\sim 25$\uasbib, which is sufficient to resolve
                  nearby supermassive black hole candidates on spatial
                  and temporal scales that correspond to their event
                  horizons. With this capability, the EHT scientific
                  goals are to probe general relativistic effects in
                  the strong-field regime and to study accretion and
                  relativistic jet formation near the black hole
                  boundary. In this Letter we describe the system
                  design of the EHT, detail the technology and
                  instrumentation that enable observations, and
                  provide measures of its performance. Meeting the EHT
                  science objectives has required several key
                  developments that have facilitated the robust
                  extension of the VLBI technique to EHT observing
                  wavelengths and the production of instrumentation
                  that can be deployed on a heterogeneous array of
                  existing telescopes and facilities. To meet
                  sensitivity requirements, high-bandwidth digital
                  systems were developed that process data at rates of
                  $64$ gigabit $s^{-1}$, exceeding those of currently
                  operating cm-wavelength VLBI arrays by more than an
                  order of magnitude. Associated improvements include
                  the development of phasing systems at array
                  facilities, new receiver installation at several
                  sites, and the deployment of hydrogen maser
                  frequency standards to ensure coherent data capture
                  across the array. These efforts led to the
                  coordination and execution of the first Global EHT
                  observations in 2017 April, and to
                  event-horizon-scale imaging of the supermassive
                  black hole candidate in M87.}

  abstract     = {We present the calibration and reduction of Event
                  Horizon Telescope (EHT) $1.3$ mm radio wavelength
                  observations of the supermassive black hole
                  candidate at the center of the radio galaxy M87 and
                  the quasar 3C 279, taken during the 2017 April 5--11
                  observing campaign. These global very long baseline
                  interferometric observations include for the first
                  time the highly sensitive Atacama Large
                  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA); reaching an
                  angular resolution of $25$ \uasbib, with
                  characteristic sensitivity limits of $\sim 1$ mJy on
                  baselines to ALMA and $\sim 10$ mJy on other
                  baselines. The observations present challenges for
                  existing data processing tools, arising from the
                  rapid atmospheric phase fluctuations, wide recording
                  bandwidth, and highly heterogeneous array. In
                  response, we developed three independent pipelines
                  for phase calibration and fringe detection, each
                  tailored to the specific needs of the EHT. The final
                  data products include calibrated total intensity
                  amplitude and phase information. They are validated
                  through a series of quality assurance tests that
                  show consistency across pipelines and set limits on
                  baseline systematic errors of $2$\% in amplitude and
                  $1^{\circ}$ in phase. The M87 data reveal the
                  presence of two nulls in correlated flux density at
                  $\sim 3.4$ and $\sim 8.3 G\lambda$ and temporal
                  evolution in closure quantities, indicating
                  intrinsic variability of compact structure on a
                  timescale of days, or several light-crossing times
                  for a few billion solar-mass black hole. These
                  measurements provide the first opportunity to image
                  horizon-scale structure in M87.}

  abstract     = {We present the first Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)
                  images of M87, using observations from April 2017 at
                  $1.3$ mm wavelength. These images show a prominent
                  ring with a diameter of $\sim 40$\uasbib,
                  consistent with the size and shape of the lensed
                  photon orbit encircling the ``shadow'' of a
                  supermassive black hole. The ring is persistent
                  across four observing nights and shows enhanced
                  brightness in the south. To assess the reliability
                  of these results, we implemented a two-stage imaging
                  procedure. In the first stage, four teams, each
                  blind to the others' work, produced images of M87
                  using both an established method (CLEAN) and a newer
                  technique (regularized maximum likelihood). This
                  stage allowed us to avoid shared human bias and to
                  assess common features among independent
                  reconstructions. In the second stage, we
                  reconstructed synthetic data from a large survey of
                  imaging parameters and then compared the results
                  with the corresponding ground truth images. This
                  stage allowed us to select parameters objectively to
                  use when reconstructing images of M87. Across all
                  tests in both stages, the ring diameter and
                  asymmetry remained stable, insensitive to the choice
                  of imaging technique. We describe the EHT imaging
                  procedures, the primary image features in M87, and
                  the dependence of these features on imaging
                  assumptions.}

  abstract     = {The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has mapped the
                  central compact radio source of the elliptical
                  galaxy M87 at $1.3$ mm with unprecedented angular
                  resolution. Here we consider the physical
                  implications of the asymmetric ring seen in the 2017
                  EHT data. To this end, we construct a large library
                  of models based on general relativistic
                  magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and
                  synthetic images produced by general relativistic
                  ray tracing. We compare the observed visibilities
                  with this library and confirm that the asymmetric
                  ring is consistent with earlier predictions of
                  strong gravitational lensing of synchrotron emission
                  from a hot plasma orbiting near the black hole event
                  horizon. The ring radius and ring asymmetry depend
                  on black hole mass and spin, respectively, and both
                  are therefore expected to be stable when observed in
                  future EHT campaigns. Overall, the observed image is
                  consistent with expectations for the shadow of a
                  spinning Kerr black hole as predicted by general
                  relativity. If the black hole spin and M87's large
                  scale jet are aligned, then the black hole spin
                  vector is pointed away from Earth. Models in our
                  library of non-spinning black holes are inconsistent
                  with the observations as they do not produce
                  sufficiently powerful jets. At the same time, in
                  those models that produce a sufficiently powerful
                  jet, the latter is powered by extraction of black
                  hole spin energy through mechanisms akin to the
                  Blandford-Znajek process. We briefly consider
                  alternatives to a black hole for the central compact
                  object. Analysis of existing EHT polarization data
                  and data taken simultaneously at other wavelengths
                  will soon enable new tests of the GRMHD models, as
                  will future EHT campaigns at 230 and 345 GHz.}

  abstract     = {We present measurements of the properties of the
                  central radio source in M87 using Event Horizon
                  Telescope data obtained during the 2017 campaign. We
                  develop and fit geometric crescent models
                  (asymmetric rings with interior brightness
                  depressions) using two independent sampling
                  algorithms that consider distinct representations of
                  the visibility data. We show that the crescent
                  family of models is statistically preferred over
                  other comparably complex geometric models that we
                  explore. We calibrate the geometric model parameters
                  using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
                  (GRMHD) models of the emission region and estimate
                  physical properties of the source. We further fit
                  images generated from GRMHD models directly to the
                  data. We compare the derived emission region and
                  black hole parameters from these analyses with those
                  recovered from reconstructed images. There is a
                  remarkable consistency among all methods and data
                  sets. We find that $>50$\% of the total flux at
                  arcsecond scales comes from near the horizon, and
                  that the emission is dramatically suppressed
                  interior to this region by a factor $>$10, providing
                  direct evidence of the predicted shadow of a black
                  hole. Across all methods, we measure a crescent
                  diameter of $42 \pm 3$\uasbib and constrain its
                  fractional width to be $< 0.5$. Associating the
                  crescent feature with the emission surrounding the
                  black hole shadow, we infer an angular gravitational
                  radius of $GM/Dc^2 = 3.8 \pm 0.4$\uasbib. Folding
                  in a distance measurement of
                  ${16.8}_{-0.7}^{+0.8}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ gives a black
                  hole mass of $M=6.5\pm 0.2|_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm
                  0.7|_{\mathrm{sys}}\times
                  {10}^{9}\hspace{2pt}$\solarmassbib. This measurement
                  from lensed emission near the event horizon is
                  consistent with the presence of a central Kerr black
                  hole, as predicted by the general theory of
                  relativity.}

                  detections at 870\,$\mu$m wavelength (345\,GHz
                  frequency) are reported, achieving the highest
                  diffraction-limited angular resolution yet obtained
                  from the surface of the Earth and the
                  highest-frequency example of the VLBI technique to
                  date. These include strong detections for multiple
                  sources observed on intercontinental baselines
                  between telescopes in Chile, Hawaii, and Spain,
                  obtained during observations in 2018 October. The
                  longest-baseline detections approach 11 G$\lambda$,
                  corresponding to an angular resolution, or fringe
                  spacing, of 19 $\mu$as. The Allan deviation of the
                  visibility phase at 870 $\mu$m is comparable to that
                  at 1.3 mm on the relevant integration timescales
                  between 2 and 100\,$s$. The detections confirm that
                  the sensitivity and signal chain stability of
                  stations in the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array
                  are suitable for VLBI observations at
                  870\,$\mu$m. Operation at this short wavelength,
                  combined with anticipated enhancements of the EHT,
                  will lead to a unique high angular resolution
                  instrument for black hole studies, capable of
                  resolving the event horizons of supermassive black
                  holes in both space and time.}

                  holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) requires
                  predictions of the polarized emission observable by
                  an Earth-based instrument for a particular model of
                  the black hole accretion system. Such predictions
                  are generated by general relativistic radiative
                  transfer (GRRT) codes, which integrate the equations
                  of polarized radiative transfer in curved
                  spacetime. A selection of ray-tracing GRRT codes
                  used within the EHT Collaboration is evaluated for
                  accuracy and consistency in producing a selection of
                  test images, demonstrating that the various methods
                  and implementations of radiative transfer
                  calculations are highly consistent. When imaging an
                  analytic accretion model, we find that all codes
                  produce images similar within a pixel-wise
                  normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.012 in the
                  worst case. When imaging a snapshot from a
                  cell-based magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we find
                  all test images to be similar within NMSEs of 0.02,
                  0.04, 0.04, and 0.12 in Stokes I, Q, U, and V,
                  respectively. We additionally find the values of
                  several image metrics relevant to published EHT
                  results to be in agreement to much better precision
                  than measurement uncertainties.}

                  Telescope (EHT) calibrator for the Galactic center's
                  black hole Sagittarius A$\^ast$. Here we present the
                  first total and linearly polarized intensity images
                  of this source obtained with the unprecedented 20
                  \uasbib resolution of the EHT. J1924--2914 is a very
                  compact flat-spectrum radio source with strong
                  optical variability and polarization. In April 2017
                  the source was observed quasi-simultaneously with
                  the EHT (April 5--11), the Global Millimeter VLBI
                  Array (April 3), and the Very Long Baseline Array
                  (April 28), giving a novel view of the source at
                  four observing frequencies, 230, 86, 8.7, and 2.3
                  GHz. These observations probe jet properties from
                  the subparsec to 100 pc scales. We combine the
                  multifrequency images of J1924--2914 to study the
                  source morphology. We find that the jet exhibits a
                  characteristic bending, with a gradual clockwise
                  rotation of the jet projected position angle of
                  about 90$^\circ$ between 2.3 and 230 GHz. Linearly
                  polarized intensity images of J1924--2914 with the
                  extremely fine resolution of the EHT provide
                  evidence for ordered toroidal magnetic fields in the
                  blazar compact core.}

  abstract     = {Recent developments in very long baseline
                  interferometry (VLBI) have made it possible for the
                  Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to resolve the
                  innermost accretion flows of the largest
                  supermassive black holes on the sky. The sparse
                  nature of the EHT's $(u,v)$-coverage presents a
                  challenge when attempting to resolve highly
                  time-variable sources. We demonstrate that the
                  changing $(u,v)$-coverage of the EHT can contain
                  regions of time over the course of a single
                  observation that facilitate dynamical imaging. These
                  optimal time regions typically have projected
                  baseline distributions that are approximately
                  angularly isotropic and radially homogeneous. We
                  derive a metric of coverage quality based on
                  baseline isotropy and density that is capable of
                  ranking array configurations by their ability to
                  produce accurate dynamical reconstructions. We
                  compare this metric to existing metrics in the
                  literature and investigate their utility by
                  performing dynamical reconstructions on synthetic
                  data from simulated EHT observations of sources with
                  simple orbital variability. We then use these
                  results to make recommendations for imaging the 2017
                  EHT \sgrabib data set.}

                  compact radio source, Sagittarius A$^\ast$ (Sgr
                  A$^\ast$), in the Galactic Center on 2017 April
                  5--11 in the 1.3 mm wavelength band. At the same
                  time, interferometric array data from the Atacama
                  Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the
                  Submillimeter Array were collected, providing
                  \sgrabib light curves simultaneous with the EHT
                  observations. These data sets, complementing the EHT
                  very long baseline interferometry, are characterized
                  by a cadence and signal-to-noise ratio previously
                  unattainable for \sgrabib at millimeter wavelengths,
                  and they allow for the investigation of source
                  variability on timescales as short as a
                  minute. While most of the light curves correspond to
                  a low variability state of \sgrabib, the April 11
                  observations follow an X-ray flare and exhibit
                  strongly enhanced variability. All of the light
                  curves are consistent with a red-noise process, with
                  a power spectral density (PSD) slope measured to be
                  between $-2$ and $-3$ on timescales between 1 minute
                  and several hours. Our results indicate a steepening
                  of the PSD slope for timescales shorter than 0.3
                  hr. The spectral energy distribution is flat at 220
                  GHz, and there are no time lags between the 213 and
                  229 GHz frequency bands, suggesting low optical
                  depth for the event horizon scale source. We
                  characterize Sgr A$^\ast$'s variability,
                  highlighting the different behavior observed just
                  after the X-ray flare, and use Gaussian process
                  modeling to extract a decorrelation timescale and a
                  PSD slope. We also investigate the systematic
                  calibration uncertainties by analyzing data from
                  independent data reduction pipelines.}

                  universal broken power-law behavior. On small
                  spatial frequencies, the residual power spectrum
                  rises as the square of the spatial frequency and is
                  proportional to the variance in the centroid of
                  emission. Beyond some peak in variability power, the
                  residual power spectrum falls as that of the
                  time-averaged source structure, which is similar
                  across simulations; this behavior can be naturally
                  explained if the variability arises from a
                  multiplicative random field that has a steeper
                  high-frequency power-law index than that of the
                  time-averaged source structure. We briefly explore
                  the ability of power spectral variability studies to
                  constrain physical parameters relevant for the GRMHD
                  simulations, which can be scaled to provide
                  predictions for black holes in a range of systems in
                  the optically thin regime. We present specific
                  expectations for the behavior of the \messierbib and
                  \sgrabib accretion flows as observed by the EHT.}

  abstract     = {The extraordinary physical resolution afforded by
                  the Event Horizon Telescope has opened a window onto
                  the astrophysical phenomena unfolding on horizon
                  scales in two known black holes, M87$^*$ and
                  Sgr~A$^*$. However, with this leap in resolution has
                  come a new set of practical complications. Sgr~A$^*$
                  exhibits intraday variability that violates the
                  assumptions underlying Earth aperture synthesis,
                  limiting traditional image reconstruction methods to
                  short timescales and data sets with very sparse
                  $(u,v)$ coverage. We present a new set of tools to
                  detect and mitigate this variability. We develop a
                  data-driven, model-agnostic procedure to detect and
                  characterize the spatial structure of intraday
                  variability. This method is calibrated against a
                  large set of mock data sets, producing an empirical
                  estimator of the spatial power spectrum of the
                  brightness fluctuations. We present a novel Bayesian
                  noise modeling algorithm that simultaneously
                  reconstructs an average image and statistical
                  measure of the fluctuations about it using a
                  parameterized form for the excess variance in the
                  complex visibilities not otherwise explained by the
                  statistical errors. These methods are validated
                  using a variety of simulated data, including general
                  relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations
                  appropriate for \sgrabib and \messierbib. We find
                  that the reconstructed source structure and
                  variability are robust to changes in the underlying
                  image model. We apply these methods to the 2017 EHT
                  observations of \messierbib, finding evidence for
                  variability across the EHT observing campaign. The
                  variability mitigation strategies presented are
                  widely applicable to very long baseline
                  interferometry observations of variable sources
                  generally, for which they provide a data-informed
                  averaging procedure and natural characterization of
                  inter-epoch image consistency.}

  abstract     = {The black hole images obtained with the Event
                  Horizon Telescope (EHT) are expected to be variable
                  at the dynamical timescale near their horizons. For
                  the black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy, this
                  timescale (5--61 days) is comparable to the 6 day
                  extent of the 2017 EHT observations. Closure phases
                  along baseline triangles are robust interferometric
                  observables that are sensitive to the expected
                  structural changes of the images but are free of
                  station-based atmospheric and instrumental
                  errors. We explored the day-to-day variability in
                  closure-phase measurements on all six linearly
                  independent nontrivial baseline triangles that can
                  be formed from the 2017 observations. We showed that
                  three triangles exhibit very low day-to-day
                  variability, with a dispersion of $\sim 3^{\circ}$
                  -- $5^{\circ}$. The only triangles that exhibit
                  substantially higher variability ($\sim 90^{\circ}$
                  -- $180^{\circ}$) are the ones with baselines that
                  cross the visibility amplitude minima on the $u-v$
                  plane, as expected from theoretical modeling. We
                  used two sets of general relativistic
                  magnetohydrodynamic simulations to explore the
                  dependence of the predicted variability on various
                  black hole and accretion-flow parameters. We found
                  that changing the magnetic field configuration,
                  electron temperature model, or black hole spin has a
                  marginal effect on the model consistency with the
                  observed level of variability. On the other hand,
                  the most discriminating image characteristic of
                  models is the fractional width of the bright ring of
                  emission. Models that best reproduce the observed
                  small level of variability are characterized by thin
                  ring-like images with structures dominated by
                  gravitational lensing effects and thus least
                  affected by turbulence in the accreting plasmas.}

                  observations of active galactic nuclei at millimetre
                  wavelengths have the power to reveal the launching
                  and initial collimation region of extragalactic
                  radio jets, down to 10$-$100 gravitational radii
                  ($r_g\equiv GM/{c^2}$) scales in nearby
                  sources. Centaurus A is the closest radio-loud
                  source to Earth. It bridges the gap in mass and
                  accretion rate between the supermassive black holes
                  (SMBHs) in Messier 87 and our Galactic Centre. A
                  large southern declination of $-43^\circ$ has,
                  however, prevented VLBI imaging of Centaurus A below
                  a wavelength of 1 cm thus far. Here we show the
                  millimetre VLBI image of the source, which we
                  obtained with the Event Horizon Telescope at 228
                  GHz. Compared with previous observations, we image
                  the jet of Centaurus A at a tenfold higher frequency
                  and sixteen times sharper resolution and thereby
                  probe sub-lightday structures. We reveal a highly
                  collimated, asymmetrically edge-brightened jet as
                  well as the fainter counterjet. We find that the
                  source structure of Centaurus A resembles the jet in
                  Messier 87 on $\sim$500 $r_g$ scales remarkably
                  well. Furthermore, we identify the location of
                  Centaurus A's SMBH with respect to its resolved jet
                  core at a wavelength of 1.3\,mm and conclude that the
                  source's event horizon shadow should be visible at
                  terahertz frequencies. This location further
                  supports the universal scale invariance of black
                  holes over a wide range of masses.}

  abstract     =  {3C 279 is an archetypal blazar with a prominent
                  radio jet that show broadband flux density
                  variability across the entire electromagnetic
                  spectrum. We use an ultra-high angular resolution
                  technique - global Very Long Baseline Interferometry
                  (VLBI) at 1.3\,mm (230\,GHz) - to resolve the
                  innermost jet of 3C\,279 in order to study its
                  fine-scale morphology close to the jet base where
                  highly variable $\gamma$-ray emission is thought to
                  originate, according to various models. The source
                  was observed during four days in April 2017 with the
                  Event Horizon Telescope at 230 GHz, including the
                  phased Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
                  (ALMA), at an angular resolution of $\sim$20\uasbib
                  (at a redshift of $z = 0.536$ this corresponds to
                  $\sim 0.13$\,pc $\sim$ 1700 Schwarzschild radii with
                  a black hole mass M$_{BH}$ $=$ $8\times
                  10^8$\solarmassbib). Imaging and model-fitting
                  techniques were applied to the data to parameterize
                  the fine-scale source structure and its
                  variation. We find a multicomponent inner jet
                  morphology with the northernmost component elongated
                  perpendicular to the direction of the jet, as imaged
                  at longer wavelengths. The elongated nuclear
                  structure is consistent on all four observing days
                  and across different imaging methods and
                  model-fitting techniques, and therefore appears
                  robust. Owing to its compactness and brightness, we
                  associate the northern nuclear structure as the VLBI
                  ``core''. This morphology can be interpreted as
                  either a broad resolved jet base or a spatially bent
                  jet. We also find significant day-to-day variations
                  in the closure phases, which appear most pronounced
                  on the triangles with the longest baselines. Our
                  analysis shows that this variation is related to a
                  systematic change of the source structure. Two inner
                  jet components move non-radially at apparent speeds
                  of $\sim$15$c$ and $\sim$20\,c($\sim$1.3 and
                  $\sim$1.7\uasbib\, day$^{-1}$, respectively), which
                  more strongly supports the scenario of traveling
                  shocks or instabilities in a bent, possibly rotating
                  jet. The observed apparent speeds are also
                  coincident with the 3C 279 large-scale jet
                  kinematics observed at longer (cm) wavelengths,
                  suggesting no significant jet acceleration between
                  the 1.3\,mm core and the outer jet. The intrinsic
                  brightness temperature of the jet components are
                  $\lesssim$ 1010 $K$, a magnitude or
                  more lower than typical values seen at $\ge$7\,mm
                  wavelengths. The low brightness temperature and
                  morphological complexity suggest that the core
                  region of 3C\,279 becomes optically thin at short
                  (mm) wavelengths.}

  abstract     = {Recent developments in compact object astrophysics,
                  especially the discovery of merging neutron stars by
                  LIGO, the imaging of the black hole in M87 by the
                  Event Horizon Telescope, and high-precision
                  astrometry of the Galactic Center at close to the
                  event horizon scale by the GRAVITY experiment
                  motivate the development of numerical source models
                  that solve the equations of general relativistic
                  magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). Here we compare GRMHD
                  solutions for the evolution of a magnetized
                  accretion flow where turbulence is promoted by the
                  magnetorotational instability from a set of nine
                  GRMHD codes: Athena++, BHAC, Cosmos++, ECHO, H-AMR,
                  iharm3D, HARM-Noble, IllinoisGRMHD, and
                  KORAL. Agreement among the codes improves as
                  resolution increases, as measured by a consistently
                  applied, specially developed set of code performance
                  metrics. We conclude that the community of GRMHD
                  codes is mature, capable, and consistent on these
                  test problems.}
